Hello world project using annotations processor

This Java project is an example of creating source code using annotations processor. 

For this project, we followed the next link:
http://hannesdorfmann.com/annotation-processing/annotationprocessing101

The project contains four .java files:                                                                                                    
 edu.rit.annotation.RepeatableAnnotations: 
	This interface allows to use the same annotation multiple times in the same place. Right now, it is not working, but it would be         corporated in the final project.
 
 edu.rit.annotation.StreamsFactory:
	Interface with two parameters:                                                                                                  
		query, the SQL statement.                                                                                                 
		name, the name of the method created for the annotation processor.

 edu.rit.annotation.processor.StreamProcessor:                                                                                           
	Process all the classes that use the StreamsFactory annotation. For every class that uses that annotation, the processor will create a   class named StreamQueries with a method which name is the value of the name attribute from StreamsFactory annotation. (This is not a     good solution, but this is just an example and the annotation is just used in one class)
 
 HelloAnnotationProcessor:
  Main class that calls StreamQueries and execute the method generated by StreamProcessor at compilation time.
